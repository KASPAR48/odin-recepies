<h2>Enjoy the best lemonade</h2>

    <p>n the 1800's this is how people made lemonadeâ€”you can do it too! It's not that difficult, and tastes wonderful!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 lemons</li>
        <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>1 quarts water</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut them into 1/2 inch slices. Set the lemons aside.</li>
        <li>Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. Let this stand for about one hour, so that the sugar begins to soak up the oils from the lemons.</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the hot water over the sugared lemon rinds. Allow this mixture to cool for 20 minutes and then remove the rinds.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, pour into pitcher and pop it in the fridge! Serve with ice cubes.</li>
